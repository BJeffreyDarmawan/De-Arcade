Game Details

'GUESS THE NUMBER'
Player chooses whether they want to guess a 1- or 2- or 3-digit number.
Player will input any number. Player must guess consecutively [berurutan] 1->2->3.
[For 2 or 3 digit number]
If the player guessed a correct number in any possition, the game will tell him or her whether the guessed 
number is at the correct possition or not. For example, the number is [392], if I guessed 4, I'll have to guess 
with other number and the game will tell me that the number does not exist in the combination. 
Then I guess 9, the game will tell me that the number exist in the combination but not at the right possition.
And I have to try until I guessed the correct combination.

SLOTS
Like common slots, there are 3 slots. Player push the lever, and the slots start rolling. Player has to hit the
button to stop each slot. Player wins when he or she aquires a certain combination of the result. 
Slots game is pretty different than the other game. We can’t give jackpot (high-rewarding output) with the same chance with low-rewarding output. 
Jackpot occurrence would be as small as possible with something like:
•	Jackpot will occur with only 15% gross chance
•	Jackpot will not occur by 80% of chance
•	So, Jackpot might occur with <15% chance (theoretically)
*and vice versa for the low-rewarding output.
