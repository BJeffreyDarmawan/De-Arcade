De Arcade

The game will be simple, user makes an account and will be given 100 credits.
Each game will require you 5 to 15 credits to play the game. Basically, the games are simple, common arcades.
There will be 3 of them, which are a 'Guess the Number' kind of game, a slot game and the other one is something 
I haven't thought of. The game will give the player wide range of prizes, from simple congratulations up to 
multiplied game credit added, depends on how he or she wins it. For example, someone gets a 7 / 7 / (cherry)
from the slot game, he or she will not hit the jackpot but win certain prize. And so for the other games.
After playing a game, player will be asked whether he or she would play again, choose other games or quit already. 
By then, the credit will already be modified to the latest amount remained.
