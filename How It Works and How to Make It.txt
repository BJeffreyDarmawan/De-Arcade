How it works?

Player insert username [Record or recall data] 
Player choose game
Player insert credit to be used [bet]
[Gameplay explained] 
Player get reward [System combine credit and reward]
Ask player to play again or play other game or quit
[Repeat, until the player quits]
System record latest balance [System store data]


What do I need to make this project?

Login system:
Requires the program to input and output file system to store informations like username, password(?) 
and remaining credit. This also requires a identification system whether the username is already recorded or not.[search]

Choose game or play again:
Switch-case I suppose.. also, loop

Gameplay:
I need to provide a really random chosen combination 
If conditions [correct or not]
Loop [try again, try again, try again till correct]

Others:
cin, cout, clear(?), quit(?), functions
